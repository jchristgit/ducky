# ducky

A Discord bot built around the champion mastery score system from League of
Legends with two main functions:

- Assigning roles based on mastery score per server
- Building mastery tables in Reddit markup

If you plan to use this yourself, you may need to change some hardcoded values
in the source.

Requirements are found in `requirements.txt`.
